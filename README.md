I had a lot of fun designing and working on this project. Utilizing Test Driven Development principles has helped rethink the way I
imagine code. I found a lot of the times the algorithm came to me very easily after coming up with the appropriate tests. This
was also the first time I have used Gradle in conjunction with IntelliJ. I challenged myself by using the Apache commons a little bit in order to work the dependencies for Gradle.


On the design: I understand my design decisions are a little strange for this one. I decided to do exclusively utility methods to 
focus on the test driven development aspects. By utilizing utility methods I was able to keep each individual method short and simple and spent far more time focusing on the test cases and structure of the tests.
